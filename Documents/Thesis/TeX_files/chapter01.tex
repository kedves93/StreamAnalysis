\section{Problem statement and motivation}
\label{chap:01:01}
In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions. Hence it is not a surprise that applications that tackle this need are in great demand. These applications use graphical representation of information and data by using visual elements like charts and graphs.

The idea started when I first came into contact with a major cloud service provider: Amazon Web Services also known as AWS.

AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. It provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. In fact, these cloud computing web services provide a set of primitive, abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools. One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS's virtual machines emulate most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) and GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk/SSD storage); a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, etc. \cite{aws-overview}

At the beginning its API seemed hard to comprehend, but with time I came to realize how easy it was in fact. Hence my determination to work with as many of its services as possible. At first I started with simple services like S3[TODO legend for S3], but then I got to understand and use services like ECS[TODO legend for ECS]. The more services I used the more Stream Anlaysis began to expand.
