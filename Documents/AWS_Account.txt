3. VPC ### EU (Frankfurt)

	- Created inside the VPC a subnet with 10.0.0.0/24 (251 IP addresses available); availabilty zone: eu-central-1a; named: stream-analysis-subnet-a

4. EC2 ### EU (Frankfurt)
	- https://bytescout.com/blog/2016/06/blog201606blog201605setting-webserver-asp-net-mvc-application-aws-ec2-html-html.html
	- Creating an EC2 instance for hosting the Web App
		- AMI: Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base - ami-0656e8790d1df60b5
		- Type: t2.micro (Variable ECUs, 1 vCPUs, 2.5 GHz, Intel Xeon Family, 1 GiB memory, EBS only)
		- VPC: stream-analysis-vpc
		- Subnet: stream-analysis-subnet-a
		- EBS - 30GB
		- Tag: Key: Name; Value: WebServer IIS EC2;
		- Created a sg named WebServer IIS SG, with inbound rules:
			- RDP - Private access to a certain IP
			- TCP port 8172 - (Used to publish the app) Private access to a certain IP
			- HTTP - Public access for the web site
	- Server Manager + Local Server + IE Enhanced Security Configuration Off
	- An ASP.NET Framework app would work, but since we want an ASP.NET Core with Angular the following must be done:
		- Install .NET Core SDK
		- Install .NET Hosting Bundle - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.1.6-windows-hosting-bundle-installer
	- The Default Web Server may be stopped, and cannot be started. It means the port 80 is in use.

5. Amazon MQ ### EU (Frankfurt)
	- Created a sg named: stream-analysis-mq-sg, with inbound rules:
		- TCP port 61617 - Public access to Broker Open Wire
		- TCP port 8162 - Public access to ActiveMQ Web Interface
	- Creating a broker named: StreamAnalysisBroker
		- Type: mq.t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1Gb RAM, Low Network)
		- Broker engine: Apache ActiveMQ
		- Username: admin
		- Password: adminPassword
		- VPC: stream-analysis-vpc
		- Subnet: stream-analysis-subnet-a

6. ECR ### EU (Frankfurt)
	- Create a repository: 526110916966.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/stream-analysis/apixu
		- Push the apixu image

7. ECS ### EU (Frankfurt)
	- Created a new subnet: stream-analysis-subnet-b
	- Created a cluster: EC2 Windows + Networking
	- The cluster recognizes the instace because the ECS AMI has a pre-installed agent
	- AWS with the cluster also creates an Auto Scaling Group and a Launch Configuration, but because of the ASG the instance cannot be stopped only terminated
	- The solution is to detach the instance from the ASG and then delete the ASC and LC.
	- A Task Definition(blueprint) is required to create a Service or a Task or a Scheduled Task.
		- The -it from "docker run -it <image_name>" is done manually by putting them into the JSON (Configure via JSON)
			 "interactive": true,
            		 "pseudoTerminal": true


8 S3 ### EU (Frankfurt)
